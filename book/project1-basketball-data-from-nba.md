from selenium import webdriver
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=r'C:\chromedriver_win32\chromedriver.exe')

url = 'https://stats.nba.com/players/list/'
driver.get(url)

soup = BeautifulSoup(driver.page_source, 'lxml')
div = soup.find('div', class_= 'stats-player-list')

for a in div.find_all('a'):
	print(a.text)

driver.quit()
```
