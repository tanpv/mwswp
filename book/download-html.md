### Download HTML Page Content

At step 2,  we will download HTML page content with selenium package. And try to control Chrome web browser in two mode normal mode and headless mode.

### Installation

First of all we need to install selenium package in order to control browser with python. Let open command prompt on Windows (terminal in Mac) and typing in.

```python
pip install selenium
```



To control Chrome, We also need to download [Chrome driver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/home) . Let choose stable version and place some where in your local.

### Control browser in normal mode

We will use `webdriver` to control Chrome browser, so the first step is import `webdriver` from `selenium` package.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
```

Then we want to create `Chrome` object, note that we need to specify abolute path where we place downloaded `chrome driver` above.

```python
driver_path = r'C:\chromedriver_win32\chromedriver.exe'
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path)
```

Now with `driver` object, we could download HTML content with `get` function. Support we want to download HTML from https://www.nba.com/. You could see that a Chome browser instance is created then NBA home page is loaded.

```python
driver.get('https://www.nba.com/')
```

Now to access HTML content, we just need to use propery `page_source`

```python
print(driver.page_source)
```

At here we complete download HTML content and print it out,  at final step we should `close` driver so you will see Chrome driver close.

```python
driver.close()
```

That it, let summary every thing again

```python
# import webdriver
from selenium import webdriver

# create Chrome object
driver_path = r'C:\chromedriver_win32\chromedriver.exe'
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path)

# access url
driver.get('https://www.nba.com/')

# access HTML content
print(driver.page_source)

# close browser
driver.close()
```



### Control browser in headless mode

Headless mode mean we still create a Chrome browser instance to download HTML but Chrome browser ***do not show up***.

Why we do not want browser to show up ?

The answer is in `headness` mode every thing will faster and our scraping script consume less cpu, ram resource. So after we build up script completely, we should running it in `headness` mode. We do normal mode when we want to debug and develop script.

To run browser in `headness` mode, the first step we need to create `ChromeOptions` object and set value to `headless` property.

```python
# create option for headness mode
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.headless = True
```

Now when we create `Chrome` object, we need put in `option` parameter.

```python
# create Chrome object with option
driver_path = r'C:\chromedriver_win32\chromedriver.exe'
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path,
                          options=options)
```

That it, let summary every thing again

```python
# import webdriver
from selenium import webdriver

# create option for headness mode
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.headless = True

# create Chrome object
driver_path = r'C:\chromedriver_win32\chromedriver.exe'
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path,
                          options=options)

# access url
driver.get('https://www.nba.com/')

# access HTML content
print(driver.page_source)

# close browser
driver.close()
```
