That it, now let do the code.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=r'C:\chromedriver_win32\chromedriver.exe')

def top_seller():
	# search web scraping
	url = 'https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers&os=win'
	driver.get(url)

	soup = BeautifulSoup(driver.page_source, 'lxml')

	# search for div contain all game
	div = soup.find('div', {'id':'search_result_container'})

	# search for a contain one game
	for a in div.find_all('a', class_='search_result_row'):

		# search for title
		span_name = a.find('span', class_='title')
		print(span_name.text)
		print(a['href'])
		print('\n')

top_seller()

driver.close()
```

and when running, we should see result
