IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, fan and critical reviews, and ratings.

We will do following tasks when scrape IMDb site:

<!-- ### Mission 1 : scrape list of best ever movies

Let do some inspection, we easy see that entire list is inside `table` tag with class `chart`

And each individual movie is inside `td` tag with class `titleColumn`

![](images/2019-08-03_17-46-43.jpg)

So we have following code to scrape all movies title

```python
from bs4 import  BeautifulSoup
from selenium import webdriver

chrome_driver_path = r'C:\chromedriver_win32\chromedriver.exe'
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=chrome_driver_path)

url = 'https://www.imdb.com/chart/top?ref_=nv_mv_250'
driver.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(driver.page_source,'lxml')

# search for table contain all title
table = soup.find('table', class_ = 'chart')

# search for each individual title
for td in table.find_all('td', class_ = 'titleColumn'):
	
	# get title and clean it up
	print(td.text.strip().replace('\n','').replace('      ',''))
```

And then running above code we will have following result

```python
"""
1.The Shawshank Redemption(1994)
2.The Godfather(1972)
3.The Godfather: Part II(1974)
4.The Dark Knight(2008)
5.12 Angry Men(1957)

```
